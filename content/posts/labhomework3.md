In this lab, I am going to build my first Unity project **Roll-A-Ball**. The step-by-step tutorial of this project can be found at [Unity's official website](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2020.2), make sure to choose the right version according to the one that you installed.

## Roll-A-Ball project
Assume that an empty 3D project is created (please look at [Lab Homework2](https://vannvatthana.github.io/vnorngSite/posts/labhomework2/)), 

### Test run
At this stage, the project is nearly completed. I need to test play the project to find out if there are any bugs that cause the game to not work properly. In my case, there were no bugs occured as I followed directly the tutorial, so the test run was successful, and it is time to build the apk (for PC) for the next lab **Roll-A-Ball VR**. 

### Build
To build an apk for any platform, go to **File > Build Setting**, then choose **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone**. Keep the default settings of the build (**Target Platform** -> **Windows** and **Architecture** -> **x86.64**).

In case there are more than one scene in the project, make sure to check on the one to build, and uncheck the rest. In my case, I have only one scene, so there is nothing to worry about. Finally, click on **Build** or **Build and Run**.
