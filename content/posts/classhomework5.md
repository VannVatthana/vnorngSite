In the Lab Homework 6, I talked about how I implemented Sloppy Robin to select the items at the supermarket. Here, I am going to talk about the evaluation of the technique. The task is to use this technique to select 20 supermarket items as fast as possible. I need 3 people (myself included) to evaluate on some criteria as follow:

### Data
Here is the full data for each person
| Measure      |  User 1: ME    | User 2   | User 3 | Average |
| ------------ | -------------  | --------------| ------------- | --------------- |
| Session Time |  321s (5mn21s) | 418s (6mn38s) | 376s (6mn11s) | 371.7s (~6mn11s)|
| Workload     |7.8             |7.5            |6|7.1|
| Presence     |7|6|6.5|6.5|
| Enjoyment    |10|9.5|9.3|9.6|

## Average time and Accuracy per session
Well, everyone seems to take quite some time to finish the task with not really high accuracy (about 6mn). That is because at the beginning, they need to be familiar with how the arrow travels, especially when they want to select a far object. 

## Task Workload
On a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being the lowest, and 10 the highest), the average score is 7.1 for how easy it is to perform a task. It is not really an easy task to select an object when the pointer does not travel in a straight line. It also takes a bit more concentration for aiming.

## Presence
On a scale from 1 to 10, the average score is 6.5 for how present the user feels in the virtual environment. 

## Enjoyment
On a scale from 1 to 10, the average score is 9.6 for how much the user enjoys playing with this technique. While it is not an efficient technique to select objects as fast as the user can, it makes the user feels really cool to be able to simulate what they can do in a carnival game.
