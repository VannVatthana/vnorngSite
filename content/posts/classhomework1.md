Here are two different scenarios that could potentially lead to collisions or physical harm between the VR user and other people/objects and how you can overcome them.

## Scenario 1 
The VR user is playing a game that requires them to move around in their real-world environment. They may not be paying attention to their surroundings and could bump into furniture, walls, or other people.

### Possible solutions
- **Use a VR play area:** Set up a designated VR play area that is free of obstacles. This will help to prevent the user from bumping into things.
- **Use boundary markers:** Some VR headsets come with boundary markers that can be placed around the play area. These markers will alert the user if they are getting too close to the edge of the play area.
- **Use guardian mode:** Guardian mode is a feature on some VR headsets that will prevent the user from moving beyond a certain boundary. This can be helpful for preventing the user from bumping into things or going into other rooms.

## Scenario 2 
The VR user is watching a 360-degree video. They may become so engrossed in the video that they forget about their surroundings and could walk into something or fall down.

### Possible solutions
- **Be aware of your surroundings:** Even though you are immersed in the VR experience, it is important to be aware of your surroundings. Take a moment to look around before you start watching a video.
- **Use a stationary chair:** If you are watching a video that is likely to make you move around, it is best to use a stationary chair. This will help to prevent you from falling down.
- **Take breaks:** If you are watching a long video, take breaks every 20-30 minutes to get up and move around. This will help to prevent you from getting too engrossed in the video and forgetting about your surroundings.
