In this post, I am going to talk about how I set up unity for my upcoming labs and projects.

## Unity Setup
First and foremost, download and install UnityHub from Unity's website: [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)

Choose the one that is suitable for your operating system. After installing the application, it will look like this:
![Project Tab](/images/labhomework2/hub_projects.png)
This is where you can create the projects you want to work on, but before that, you need to install at least one Unity version first.
On the tab **Install**, click on **Install Editor**.

Click **Install** on the version of your choice.

If you want to install the older versions, feel free to go to 
[https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). In my case, I installed the version 2020.3.34f1 . 

## Create a new project
Now that a Unity version is installed, go back to **Projects** and click on **New Project**, then choose the right template, right directory, and rename your project. For this case, I choose 3D template for my Unity 3D project.

Finally click **Create project**, and congratulations, you have an empty 3D environment that you can work on!
