## What is CAVE System?
**CAVE** (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) is a room-sized VR system that uses projectors to display images on all of the walls, floor, ceiling. This creates a completely immersive experience for the users so that they feel as if they are inside the virtual world.

## Differences between CAVE and HMD devices

1. CAVE :
- A room-sized VR system that uses projectors to display images on all walls, floor, and ceiling
- Creates a completely immersive experience for the user
- Typically used for scientific visualization, medical training, and entertainment.

2. Head-Mounted Display:
- Helmet-like devices that display images directly to the user's eyes
- Can track the user's head movements more accurately
- More portable than CAVE systems
- Typically used for gaming and entertainment

| Features      | CAVE          | HMD      |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Immersion     | High          | Moderate |
| Portability   | Low           | High     |
| Cost          | High          | Low      |
| Calibratioin  | Difficult     | Easy     |
| Head Tracking | Less accurate | More accurate |
| Application   | Scientific    | Gaming, entertainment |

## Advantages and Disadvantages of both systems
1. CAVE
    + Advantages
        - High level of immersion
        - Can be used by multiple users simultaneously
        - Does not require users to wear any equipment
        - Can be used for a wider range of applications
    + Disadvantages
        - Expensive to set up and maintain
        - Requires a large amount of space
        - Can be difficult to calibrate
2. HMD
    + Advantages
        - Portable and easy to set up
        - More affordable than CAVE systems
        - Can track the user's head movements more accurately
    + Disadvantages
        - Less immersive than CAVE systems
        - Can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods
        - Can cause motion sickness in some users
        - Typically used for a narrower range of applications

## CAVE in Reality-Virtuality Continuum of Milgram
The CAVE overlays virtual images onto the real world rather than completely replacing it, so I think that it fits into the Augmented Reality (AR) end of the continuum.

When more people are experiencing this system at the same time, CAVE's position in the continuum is still the same. This is because it stills overlays the virtual environment into the real world, and all the users inside the system are aware of their surrounding. Therefore, CAVE is still an AR system.
